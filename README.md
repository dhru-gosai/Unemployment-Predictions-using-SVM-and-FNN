Predicting unemployment rates using support vector machines (SVM) and feed-forward neural networks (FNN)

Machine learning has gained enormous popularity in last few decades due to how efficiently and elegantly it could provide solutions using big data. From 1957 when Frank Rosenblatt designed the first neural network for computers which simulated the thought processes of a human brain (Marr, 2016) to creating deep learning algorithms to comprehend speech-to-text; when these algorithms implemented correctly, they can help anticipate global crisis and assist in creating policies to overcome those catastrophes.

One such issue of interest is unemployment rates in Australia between Mar-2018 and Sep-2020. This period is critical to building a model as none of the global economies predicted such downfall in national GDP and employment rates.

The research paper aimed to create SVM and ANN algorithms to try predict unemployment rates with minimum error rate and create opportunity for further research into implementing ML techniques into macro-economic field.
